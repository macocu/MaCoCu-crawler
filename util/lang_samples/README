Sample plaintext in the target language should be placed in this directory.
The file name must be the same as the language, e.g. "English".
For example, you can use texts from general English web documents and English
Wikipedia articles. The recommended size of the file is at least 50 kB.
Make sure the text is really clean and representing the language well --
e.g. no Greek letters or references in square brackets in Wikipedia articles,
no encoding errors, no web garbage such as URIs.
